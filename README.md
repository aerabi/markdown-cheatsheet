# GitHub Markdown Cheatsheet

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, mostly used for writing readmes. Each platform supporting Markdown usually adds its own flavors to it. GitHub is no exception, just recently adding support for writing mathematical formulae.

## Headings
Similar to HTML, there are 6 headings in Markdown:

```markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

Try to use heading level 1 for the title of your document, h2 for the sections, h3 for subsections, and so on.

## Alternate Headings
There is an alternate way of creating headings that only supports two levels:

```markdown
Heading Level 1
===============

Heading Level 2
---------------
```

## Paragraphs
Paragraphs are chunks of text separated by at least a blank line:

```markdown
This is paragraph 1.

This is paragraph 2.
```

## Line Breaks
Line break is less know to the Markdown world.  
It is achieved by adding at least two spaces to the end of the line:

```markdown
This is line 1.  
This is line 2.
```

It's less known, because it's invisible. But, try it out.


[^1]: Here I made the words half bold. It showcases two things: 1. Making texts bold in the middle of the word. 2. Markdown footnotes. It is known that making the words half bold makes it easier and faster for your mind to read it. It's called bionic reading.
